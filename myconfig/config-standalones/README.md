# `/config-standalones/` directory notes

The `nginx.conf.OLD` file is a copy of the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file found in my original testing system. This file will not work with the current state of this repository, and is only included for reference.

The `nginx.conf.BACKUP` file is a copy of my CURRENT nginx configuration. This is verified to "work" with the current state of this repository.

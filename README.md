# simshadows/rutorrent-myconfig

This repository is a copy of the [original rutorrent repository](https://github.com/Novik/ruTorrent), with my custom configuration changes.

I only merge in official releases, or fixes.

## Changes compared to upstream

Most of my files are contained in `/myconfig/`.

Some other important changes are:

- `/conf/config.php`
- Plugins are removed/added as needed from `/plugins/`.
	- Removed plugins are kept in `/myconfig/removed-plugins/`.

## Absolute Filepaths

I'm currently using absolute filepaths, but I'll be looking into using relative filepaths instead.

If an instance folder must be moved to a different location, you'll need to run my instance migration script `migrate-instance.py`, and run `setup-instance.sh` again:

```
# chown -R simshadows INSTANCEDIR
# sudo -u simshadows bash
$ ./migrate-instance.py INSTANCEDIR OLDINSTANCEDIR
$ exit
# ./setup-instance.sh INSTANCEDIR INSTANCENAME PORT
```

Do note that I ran `migrate-instance.py` in a safer non-root user. I just prefer to do it this way if I'm using dependencies that I don't necessarily trust. In this case, I'm using a bencode library.

Once you're done running `migrate-instance.py`, the `setup-instance.sh` will redo all file permissions.

## TODO

Things I want done:

- Isolate all my custom files to `/myconfig/` somehow.
	- This reduces the pain of reconciling merge conflicts.
- Improve the usability of the basic scripts
	- Particularly solve the challenges of user checking and privilege escalation.

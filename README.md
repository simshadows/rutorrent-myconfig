# simshadows/custom\_rutorrent

This repository is a copy of the original [rutorrent repository](https://github.com/Novik/ruTorrent), with my custom configuration changes.

## Notes-to-self on repo maintenance

It is recommended to have a remote to upstream in order to update rutorrent:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Novik/ruTorrent
```

I only merge to official releases.

# ruTorrent

ruTorrent is a front-end for the popular Bittorrent client [rtorrent](http://rakshasa.github.io/rtorrent).

This project is released under the GPLv3 license, for more details, take a look at the LICENSE.md file in the source.

## Main features

* Lightweight server side, so it can be installed on old and low-end servers and even on some SOHO routers
* Extensible - there are several plugins and everybody can create their own one
* Nice look ;)

## Getting started

  * There's no installation routine or compilation necessary. The sources are cloned/unpacked into a directory which is setup as document root of a web server of your choice (for detailed instructions see the [webserver wiki article](https://github.com/Novik/ruTorrent/wiki/WebSERVER).
  * After setting up the webserver `ruTorrent` itself needs to be configured. Instructions can be found in various articles in the [wiki](https://github.com/Novik/ruTorrent/wiki).
